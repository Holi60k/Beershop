##What is it about?
The beershop is a shop where people can register & login and buy some nice beer.
When you register you have to add some of your personal (sure :) ) informations and then you can buy beers.
There are some kind of restrictions, there are a few ranks you have to earn,
first when you register and you can only make 3 orders a day, then later it can be more.
With every order your experience points are increased and you can level up.

There are always good discounts so you should check us evey day :)
